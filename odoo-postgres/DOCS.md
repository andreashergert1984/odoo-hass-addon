This addon creates a postgres server run in Home Assistant so that you can have the benefit to use it with Odoo.

Note that this addon does not run Odoo itself.

## Configuration

<!-- ### Option: `server`

The `server` option sets the address of the Frigate server.

This must be in the format `host:port`. The following are valid examples:

- `frigate.local:5000`
- `192.168.0.101:5000` -->
